# Project Summary
The Cloud-based Book Recommendation Service project aims to provide users with personalized book recommendations through a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly cloud-based computation service. 

## Purpose, Scope, and Objectives
**Purpose**

The purpose of the project is to develop and deploy a cloud-based computation service for personalized book recommendations. The scope encompasses the design, development, and deployment, including database setup, backend development, frontend development, and deployment on a cloud platform. The primary objective is to provide users with accurate and relevant book recommendations based on their preferences and reading habits, enhancing their overall reading experience.

**Objective**

The objective of this project is to develop and deploy a cloud-based computation service that offers personalized book recommendations to users based on their preferences and reading habits. The service will utilize a NoSQL database for storing book data, and preferences, and will employ Java for backend development and Python for machine learning algorithm development. For user interface design, React will be used. The project aims enhance the recommendation process.
Main objectives of web application are as follows;
- User can give preferences and reading habits, then the ML model will suggest one or more books,
- A user-friendly design that will be tested by the end user.

**Scope**

The project encompasses the design, development and deployment of a cloud-based computation service. It includes the setup of a NoSQL database, implementation of backend services for data processing and computation, development of a user interface for interaction, and deployment on a cloud platform. The service will provide book recommendations through a web application, ensuring scalability, reliability, and user satisfaction.
